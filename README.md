# Capstone Project (PerScholas)
 This is my Capstone Project for Per Scholas. The application is a Guest List Management Tool that can be used by event organizers catering to special special international events. 
 The main function of the application is to take record of the Guest Attendance and the particular ticket types they are holding. Most international private events of this particular kind
 (private auctions, charity, private gatherings) usually have specific clientels and this app is meant to cater for such need.

## Frontend

The technologies used in for the frontend are HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, React, React-router, axios, mapbox, and the Bootstrap library.

## Backend

The technolgies used for the backend are Java and Spring Boot.

## Future plans for the project.

I intend to add more features for the project like Geo-tagging guests since this is an international event/guests management tool.
In addition, having data analysis implemented based on geolocation data is something that I will be working on.
(This is a work in progress and will continue to be updated until fully working).
